	 <h2>Celebrate and invite for a cake</h2>

	  <p>
	       <a href="/news/2014/news-20140424-01.html#id-the-icing-on-the-cake"><img class="left" src="/graphics/getinvolved/dfd-cake-2014-250px.png"/></a>
	    
	      Initially introduced as a gift for a DFD award, in recent years it became tradition for many local groups to celebrate DFD with a cake. This can be an invitation for the organisers, for an award winner or for everyone. Cakes are like Open Standards and you find them around the wold. Don't forget to make a picture of your cake and send it to us. We love them.<br style="clear:both" />
	  </p>
  
	<h2>Get attention from public bodies</h2>

	  <p>
	      <a href="/graphics/getinvolved/uni.jpg"><img class="left" src="/graphics/getinvolved/uni-250px.jpg"/></a>
	    
	      Do you want your government, your University or any public body to use Open Standards? Then this is the day to go there and inform them about it. If it's a public institution like a University or a library, you might ask for permission to set up a booth for a day inside the building. If it is about a public administration, you might be more lucky if you ask for permission to set up a booth in front of the building. Don't forget to take pictures and let us know about. <br style="clear:both" />
	  </p>

	<h2 id="award">Give an award</h2>

	    <p>
	      
		  <a href="/graphics/getinvolved/DFD-award-2014.jpg"><img class="left" src="/graphics/getinvolved/DFD-award-2014-250px.jpg" /></a>
	      
	    
		  If there is an organisation, a public body or a company that you think of
		  as a good example in the field of Open Standards, you can recognize their effort
		  and support their activities by giving them an award. Many groups gave out a
		  certificate and a cake <a href="/news/news.html">in the past</a>. Read more about <a href="prize-funding.html">How to award a Document Freedom Day Prize</a>.<br style="clear:both" />
	    </p>

	<h2 id="presentation">Give a presentation</h2>

	
	    <p>
	    
	    
	      <a href="/graphics/getinvolved/presentation.jpg"><img class="left" src="/graphics/getinvolved/presentation-250px.jpg" /></a>

	      Give a public presentation about Open Standards or try to initiate one by inviting speakers and well-known persons to talk about Open Standards. Local hackerspaces or Universities might be open to offer you a room for this. Do not forget to promote your event adequately, to get a lot of participants.<br style="clear:both" />
